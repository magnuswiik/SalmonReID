This is the codebase for the Master´s thesis:
"Assessing Re-Identification Capabilities of Salmon Body Parts Using AI-Based Computer Vision Methods" by Magnus Wiik

Core libraries used in this codebase: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas and LabelMe

The codebase has three folders: Prototyping, Report and SalmonReIDPipeline.

Prototyping contains jupyter notebooks for quick testing during model developement, and tasks for data organization and cleaning. 

Report contains images and test results that is used in the Master´s thesis. This folder can be ignored.

SalmonReIDPipeline contains the code for re-identification pipeline. Inside you have detection and identification folders, which contain code for their tasks.
There is also a folder for point estimation, which was tested during the Master´s thesis, but was not implemented in the final pipeline. However, this code is functioning and can be built further upon.
